# katai
A simple ai for detecting cat breeds I set myself as a personal milestone of doing. It will probably be garbage, so I'm not able to recommend using it, however I will be both documenting the whole process of development in python files and writing somewhat of a devvlog in this file, so you can see how making an ai semi from scratch looks like.

## Day 0
This day was pretty much spent on setting up github and doing research, not much to say here. My main sources will be "Machine Learning - Pocket Reference" by Matt Harrison and "Machine Learning Desing Patterns" by Valliappa Lakshmanan, Sara Robinson and Michael Munn. And the internet, of course.
